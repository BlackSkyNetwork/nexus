Blockchain is the use of technology and mathematics to create an ever-evolving ledger of information that cannot be altered or fudged.

"),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"A negative claim some have made about crypto is that it is just another institution of old cronies at the top who invest and get richer and richer while less wealthy investors miss the really big booms of rising values in various currencies. The problem with this argument is that the crypto community continually evolves. More people are grafted into the counterculture, and with them, come new ideas or questions about what blockchain can do in tandem with the changing needs of society. The natural pitfall of a trading market in which the rich keep getting richer is bound to happen, but in crypto, each new generational wave of community members can extend what is already possible with cryptocurrency into new structures that can benefit humanity and provide financial freedom. Investing now is not a dead end. Investing now just means you\u2019re entering the community with a cohort of others who, depending on your individual and collective participation, can shape the community as it moves forward. For instance, the recent popularity of buying and selling NFTs as a form of investment has been a way waves of newcomers from over the last decade, who, for instance, missed out investing in Bitcoin in its pre-boom era, could get involved in one new way crypto attracts newcomers who could grow their wealth in a movement with considerable momentum behind it.
