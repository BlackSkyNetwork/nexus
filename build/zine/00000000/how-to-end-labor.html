href="/zine/00000000/transformative-autonomous-organizations">newly proposed organization model</a>, and include a pillar that they <em>aim to end labor</em>.  In this article I want to share two initial ideas of what that can look like. The first design is partially inspired by Robert Anton Wilson&#x27;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100613011108/http://whywork.org/rethinking/whywork/rawilson.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RICH Economy</a>. The second design is inspired by &quot;Universal Basic Needs&quot; and has an approach related to acquiring land. These ideas can either be attempted in synergy or independently.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="idea-1-taos-are-heavily-augmented-by-ai">Idea 1: TAOs are heavily augmented by AI<a class="hash-link" href="#idea-1-taos-are-heavily-augmented-by-ai" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>To achieve a potential roadmap for how we can end labor with the assistance of AI, let&#x27;s first define a few different organization types, that an organization would progress through:</p><ul><li>Type I organizations: 40 hrs / week is considered the baseline for full-time labor.</li><li>Type II organizations: 20 hrs / week is considered the baseline for full-time labor.</li><li>Type III organizations: 20 hrs / week is considered the baseline for full-time labor and a large number of workers operate as AI stewards.</li><li>Type IV organizations: 20 hrs / month is considered the baseline for full-time labor, and there is a very small human work force.</li></ul><p>The core drive that will allow a Type I organization to become a Type IV organization, where labor has essentially ended, is that tasks that are menial, repetitive, or boring should be replaced by automation where possible. When this happens, though, it&#x27;s important to decrease the hours of week that constitutes full-time labor.</p><p>Type I organizations can be thought as similar to the organizations of today, with one difference. When a member of a Type I TAO uses up their own free time to come up with an innovation that reduces their work week by (x) hours, they will get granted a work-week upgrade as will at least one non-technical worker who cannot write code to automate their work. In addition to this, they will also receive a bonus, depending on the number of other&#x27;s work-weeks this impacts (the number of other people working in the organization who will be able to utilize the code upgrade).</p><p>A work-week upgrade is a reduction in expected amount of time to dedicate to the organization, while maintaining or increasing one&#x27;s salary.</p><p>Let&#x27;s take the following (rough) example <!-- -->[note: need to update some of this math / numbers]<!-- -->:</p><ul><li>Alice invents <code>Automation_A</code> which results in her no longer having to do <code>Task_A</code>. <code>Task_A</code> took about 10 hours of Alice&#x27;s time a week. Alice is currently paid $200,000/year for a full-time 40 hr/wk job.</li><li>There are 10 other people who have the same role as Alice, where this automation can be applied.</li><li>This automation also resulted in 10 different people who had full-time non-technical jobs doing <code>Task_B</code> becoming obsolete. They were being paid $50,000/year each. </li></ul><p>Alice&#x27;s invention has resulted in the organization reducing its costs by $1,000,000/year <!-- -->[ ($200,000 <code>*</code> 0.25 <code>*</code> 10) <code>+</code> (10 <code>*</code> $50,000) ]<!-- -->, but instead of reducing costs, there is instead a work-week upgrade:</p><ul><li>Alice, as the inventor of an automation that has led the organization to saving potentially $1M/year, can now become an Entreprenuer in Residence and has more freedom to work on whatever they want, for the next 3 years, while still being paid $200,000/year. They get a $100,000 bonus which they can use for personal spending or as working capital for their projects.</li><li>The 10 other people who were also doing <code>Task_A</code> will get a work-week reduction of 40 hrs - (x/2), as will the non-technical workers doing Task_B.</li><li>Those who were doing <code>Task_B</code> now are part of the available work force to work alongside Alice. Some will have the skills to work with Alice, and others are spending their time now on &quot;on-the-job training&quot; to learn the new skills that can&#x27;t be automated so easily yet.</li></ul><p>This can keep happening with new innovations, yet the sum of x should not exceed 20 hours until the TAO has advanced to a Type II organization.</p><p>Type III organizations have been heavily augmented with robots, artificial intelligence and code. The human work force has been heavily reduced to human agents who review the complaints and support requests that have been unresolved by AI agents.</p><p>In Type IV organizations, the bots in the network are very smart, yet a handful of humans are stewarding them. </p><p>Everyone who was working for the TAO from stages I-III are economic beneficiaries and governors of the Type IV TAO. It&#x27;s important for the human agents who are helping advance the bots to receive fair economic rewards, as opposed to how legacy corporations work today where the support agents get the least amount of equity, yet it&#x27;s their labor that is leading toward the advanced model, and it is their job that will be replaced soon due to this labor. I don&#x27;t think we should personally be putting trust into a government controlled UBI to solve for the scenario where almost all organizations in the world are Type IV organizations, so it will be important to proactively account for this, and have systems that more fairly value the advancement of artificial intelligence.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="idea-2-taos-acquire-and-develop-land">Idea 2: TAOs acquire and develop land<a class="hash-link" href="#idea-2-taos-acquire-and-develop-land" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>I believe that another possible path that can be considered, for the AI minimalists, is that when a TAO reaches a stage of financial sustainability and is generating considerable profits, it should consider allocating a minimum percentage of it&#x27;s profit margin to purchase and develop land. This land development budget will be managed by non-profit organization within the TAO network. Any TAO that puts in money towards land development will then be able to offer affordable housing to members of their TAO.</p><p>In this land the TAO organizations acquire, there can be different economic rules. For example one rule can be: there is no concept of rent that you pay to a landlord. Instead, all property in the TAO’s network can be “rent to own”. Another rule can be that ideally a simple 3 bedroom house can be owned with 8 years of labor maximum. TAO housing will have food gardens, access to fresh water (via either rain water collection or wells), and will have it&#x27;s own independent power generation. There will be a small yearly maintenance cost paid, and this cost can go to $0 if you participate in maintenance for the housing or if the maintenance is increasingly done by AI / robots. </p><p>It will be important that TAOs land is not a dystopian company town that you read about in sci-fi novels. One of the goals with TAOs land development is to move away from housing being a speculative investment, as opposed to a necessary cost for getting your basic needs met, that doesn&#x27;t enrich a landlord. </p><p>When one outgrows their TAOs housing, they can sell the house to another in the TAO housing network (at cost) and buy a house in the &quot;real world&quot;, if that is what they want. I imagine that there will be non-profit TAO owned land that borders other land and economic experiments within the network. The goal of this approach though, is that if affordable housing is built in a community setting. As soon as one fully owns a home, they can also quit working for the TAO, if it wasn&#x27;t serving them fully. By offering affordable housing, food, water, and energy to more humans, faster, I imagine that there will be a very large reduction in the work force, which will be good for the world. We need to reduce bullshit jobs if we actually care about our ecosphere. So it&#x27;s actually good if people quit their TAOs jobs, as it provides more opportunities for people who work really shitty jobs to then work for a TAO and also reach economic freedom faster.</p><p>I imagine that when people have this free time now, and reduced stress to get their basic needs met, that they will likely congregate with others in the community and really create the TAO that they&#x27;d rather be a part of. The hypothesis is that this free time and mental expansion will actually lead towards <em>better</em> and <em>necessary</em> innovation in addition to artistic freedom. As each individual’s mental capacities will be unshackled from mundane tasks, and people are less anxious about the base level of Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs, then contributing new ideas to society will be something exciting that strengthens society as a whole.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-tags-row row margin-bottom--sm"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_XVD_ padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/tags/ideas">Ideas</a></li><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/tags/ta-os">TAOs</a></li><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/tags/ai">AI</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/BlackSkyNetwork/nexus/edit/main/docs/zine/00000000/how-to-end-labor.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_dcUD" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_foO9"><span class="theme-last-updated">Last updated<!-- --> on <b><time datetime="2022-06-23T14:17:32.000Z">6/23/2022</time></b></span></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/zine/00000000/how-to-anonymize-eth"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">How to Anonymize Ethereum</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/zine/00000000/zentaipunks"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Zentaipunks: A Rhizomatic Collaborative Jam Exploring Privacy...</div></a></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_cNA8 thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#idea-1-taos-are-heavily-augmented-by-ai" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Idea 1: TAOs are heavily augmented by AI</a></li><li><a href="#idea-2-taos-acquire-and-develop-land" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Idea 2: TAOs acquire and develop land</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Black Sky Nexus • 2022 • Written content licensed <a target="_blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a> unless otherwise noted</div></div></div></footer></div>
