On 02-Feb-2022, Rachel-Rose O'Leary, writer, programmer, and [DarkFi](https://dark.fi) coder, presented her thesis on the emerging anonymous underside of the cryptocurrency industry, *Lunarpunk and the Dark Side of the Cycle*. Today we are sharing the video for broader distribution, uploaded to YouTube, a platform owned by the godfathers of surveillance technology. 

*Note: this thesis was also recently published on eGirl Capital's blog, [yet in written form](https://www.egirlcapital.com/insights/107533289).*

O'Leary is making a provactive claim that: 
* Ethereum is solarpunk
* Solarpunk favors transparency
* Transparency integrates authoritarianism

...hence Ethereum integrates authoritarianism.

> "By favoring transparency in its systems and by necessitating a strong concept of identity as do the current paradigms of DAOs, and quadratic voting, and UBI - Solarpunk integrates the dual charachteristics of its central system: it integrates authoritarianism through its tendendency towards transparency."

She then presents Lunarpunk as an alternate ideology


O'Leary's motives are clear: she seems very interested in trying to re-align the blockchain development community to not forget it's cypherpunk roots.

Cypherpunks never wanted a fully transparent system of electronic money. As Eric Hughes states in *A Cypherpunk's Manifesto* in 1993:

> "We the Cypherpunks are dedicated to building anonymous systems. We are defending our privacy with cryptography, with anonymous mail forwarding systems, with digital signatures, and with electronic money."

Or as Tim May stated in *The Cryptoanarchist Manifesto* even earlier, in 1988:
> "Computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for individuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other in a totally anonymous manner. Two persons may exchange messages, conduct business, and negotiate electronic contracts without ever knowing the True Name, or legal identity, of the other."

What's unique about the video presentation of her thesis though is that she begins the presentation by talking about how Irish society was organized thousands of years ago and the society's relationship with trees.

> "The earliest Irish alphabet takes its names from trees and its shapes from branches. In the ancient legal code, the Brehon Law, trees were collectively owned. And damaging a tree was an offense punishable by death.

She goes on to speak about how Ireland now has the lowest tree coverage in all of Europe.
