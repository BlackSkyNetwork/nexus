Federated infrastructure but user sovereignty: a “third way” between federated and P2P networks'

There are two kinds of protocols from the "open web" scene that aim to
replace centralized Big Tech platforms: **federated** and
**peer-to-peer**. Federated protocols, like
[Matrix](https://matrix.org/) and [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/),
are essentially modeled after email: there are still servers and
clients, but anyone can run a server, and the whole network runs off of
open-source software and open standards. Peer-to-peer protocols, like
[Tox](https://tox.chat/) and
[Freenet](https://freenetproject.org/index.html), follow the BitTorrent
model of there simply being *peers* — the end-users — that somehow
collaborate to form a coherent distributed network.

With the exception of content-addressed P2P file sharing networks
(BitTorrent and IPFS), the semi-successful protocols are almost all
federated. Matrix (a federated protocol) may not be nearly as polished
as Telegram or Discord, but at least communities of non-techy people use
it — that can't really be said of P2P alternatives. We may want fully
egalitarian infrastructure in which every user is a server and "[every
man a king](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Every_Man_a_King_(song))", but
that seems to mean tons of technical complexity and tradeoffs that
nearly deny the possibility of "Web2"-like convenience.

But federated protocols don't quite cut it. To be sure, they can be
pretty decentralized — there are probably more email servers than public
BitTorrent DHT nodes. But we still often see the usual signs of
centralization, like
[censorship](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org/issues/373) and
[desperate appeals through centralized
advocacy](https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/19/combating-abuse-in-matrix-without-backdoors)
to forestall it. In practice, current federated protocols don't actually
provide a meaningful leap towards the "open web" ideal of user autonomy,
especially compared to security-focused centralized platforms like
Signal (as Signal's founder [pretty convincingly
argues](https://signal.org/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving/)!). When I want
to help normal folks improve their online security and mitigate mass
surveillance — especially friends in China who actually *need*
high-security communication — I recommend Signal or even Telegram rather
than Matrix, since *Matrix doesn't fix any problems that Signal doesn't
fix under a realistic threat model*.

## Sovereignty, not (de)centralization

This is because nobody cares about decentralization *per se*. What
people actually want is **user sovereignty**: the key security
properties of the system being upheld by correct behavior of users, not
third parties. For a secure communication system, that means the ["CIA"
triad](https://www.coursera.org/articles/cia-triad) of confidentiality,
integrity, and authentication should depend only on the end users
following the protocol (i.e. "end-to-end encryption"). In Signal's case,
we *almost* have user sovereignty — as long as we trust Signal not to
lie about users' public keys, not collect too much metadata, and stay
online. And the problem with federated protocols is that just like
Signal and other centralized protocols, we typically have **provider
sovereignty**: Matrix homeservers, email hosts, etc, rather than users
uphold the most important security properties.

But we don't need to go the whole P2P hog to get robust user
sovereignty. Cryptography lets us separate who stores and routes data
from who truly owns it. We can combine the easier infrastructure design
of a federated protocol with the full decentralized security of a
peer-to-peer protocol.

In other words, we can build **confederal protocols**: *user sovereignty
plus federated infrastructure*. In a confederal protocol, there are
still users and providers. But users don't *belong* to providers, the
way they belong to web2 platforms or email hosts. They're merely
*customers* of providers offering services like routing and storage,
free to shop around and switch providers without any disruption to their
user experience. You can think of a confederal network as one where
every user is independent and sovereign, but free to trade and
specialize without any protocol-enforced peer-to-peer egalitarianism.

|                     | Centralized | Federated    | Confederal   | Peer-to-peer |
|---------------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| *Infrastructure*    | One server  | Many servers | Many servers | Just peers   |
| *Who is sovereign?* | Provider    | Providers    | Users        | Users        |

Few federated protocols today are confederal. But there's one surprising
exception: *the Internet itself*. Internet users usually don't self-host
services, but use many different websites and ISPs, federated using a
quasi-centralized naming network (DNS). Your cyberspace self does not
belong to Facebook, AT&T, or the like, and you can easily switch
providers — or even host your own website — without leaving the
Internet. Even most P2P fans believe in the power of a confederal
protocol, given that their networks still depend on the Internet.

But what would an application-level confederal protocol look like? After
all, the Internet just needs to move packets, but something like a chat network
needs complex abstractions — user profiles, groups, and all that.

## Xirtam: a confederal chat protocol

Let's envision **Xirtam** /ʃɚ.ˈtɑːm/, a *confederal Matrix replacement*
. Recall that Matrix has full-on, email-like provider sovereignty: you
register an account at a **homeserver**, which gives you an account
local to that server (looking something like
*@alice:aliceandbob.example.com*). All your interactions with the Matrix
world go through this homeserver — sending messages to other users,
including users of other servers, receiving messages, etc — and the
optional end-to-end encryption uses PKI controlled by homeservers. Even
joining groups on other homeservers is mediated by your homeserver,
which must synchronize messages with the other server, similar to how
joining an mailing list works in the email world.

In Xirtam, on the other hand, there's no such thing as a "homeserver".
Every username belongs in the same unified namespace (just *@alice*),
bound globally to a public key controlled by the end user. We still have
servers for hosting chat groups of all sizes, and metadata of these
servers is stored within the same naming system. The boundaries of each
server will probably correspond to some autonomous online community,
just like a forum website, though there would probably be servers
specializing in hosting general chatboards for others — the Reddits of
the Xirtamverse. Users log in to a community's server by directly
contacting it and presenting their globally recognized credentials.

Direct user-to-user messages are handled by the user picking a
**concierge**, a server whose job it is to backup DM history, serve user
avatars, etc to people. Users advertise which server is their concierge
on the global naming system; delivering messages means first finding the
other user's concierge and directly pushing it a message. Concierges may
also offer reverse-proxying to other Xirtam servers — a useful service
for people with limited Internet connectivity who may not be able to
reach all servers.

Unlike Matrix homeservers, Xirtam servers have no sovereignty to speak
of. Servers do not own users, only groups, and no server can control —
or even necessarily see — what a user does on other servers. Most user
communities control their own servers, and even when they do not, group
admins can "ragequit" an abusive server simply by uploading a backup of
the member list and message history to another server and notifying all
members through DM with a standardized host-switch message.

Concierges might look *a little* like homeservers, but unlike
homeservers, concierges cannot control anything important (like the
public key!) on a user's profile, and a bad concierge who censors or
attacks users (say, by vandalizing their profile) will quickly fall into
disuse. Switching to a better provider is just a matter of editing the
namespace entry that names the concierge for a user.

Ultimately, Xirtam users enjoy full user sovereignty equivalent to using
any P2P chat protocol. *Confidentiality* and *Integrity* are entirely in
the hands of the user-controlled naming system, and even *Availability*
can be secured by end users, by shunning unreliable or censorious
servers.

But from the federated architecture, they enjoy many features *very*
difficult to build in P2P networks:

-   *Reliable async message delivery*: concierges buffer messages just
    like email servers do, avoiding the need to constantly be online
    ircd style
-   *Unified user and group discovery*: client-side spiders crawl the
    global naming system, as well as the group directories of all the
    servers named within
-   *Sybil resistance and anti-spam*: servers are incentivized to
    experiment with and evolve better, fairer policies to serve both its
    group and concierge customers. Users are not conscripted to be
    infrastructure, avoiding the perverse outcome where spamming/DDoSing
    a P2P network causes peers to leave and capacity to reduce rather
    than increase.

It wouldn't be a huge exaggeration to say that *Xirtam is the "end of
history" for chat apps*, and confederal protocols are probably the
optimal point on the centralized-to-peer-to-peer curve.

## How can we build this?

So if Xirtam is so cool, why wasn't Matrix built this way? The security
benefits are obvious, and Xirtam might even be simpler than Matrix to
implement — there's no more complex inter-homeserver synchronization.

The astute reader may have noticed that one thing supports a *lot* of
security-critical functionality — the "global namespace", queriable and
editable by all users using a user-controlled keypair, and magically
consistent and incorruptible despite whatever evil servers and ISPs and
other gremlins may do.

Sadly, nothing like that exists (yet). It's basically distributed
systems
[handwavium](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=handwavium).

<img src="https://nullchinchilla.me/content/images/2023/03/image-7.png"
class="kg-image" loading="lazy" width="500" height="582" />
</figure>

The obvious ways to implement this namespace are wrong:

-   *Centralized name directory*: degenerates the whole thing back to a
    centralized system, where the centralized sovereignty of the name
    infrastructure rules with an iron fist. Good job!
-   *Peer-to-peer DHT of some form*: this just ends up being a P2P
    protocol. Ensuring consistency, Sybil-resistance, availability, etc
    of this DHT is probably just as hard as building a P2P chat. If not
    actually harder — names have much stronger consistency requirements
    than chat histories!

The "standard" solution here is to use some sort of public blockchain.
Indeed, combining user sovereignty with global consistency is *the*
blockchain killer-app, not bonding curves or NFTs or whatever.

But before you get too excited and start loading up on bitcoins,
building a reasonably usable Xirtam global namespace is *very*
nontrivial even with blockchains. You can't just slap something on ENS
and call it a day. Normal people don't enjoy interacting with crypto
wallets and blockchains, let alone paying gas fees. So "just put it on
the blockchain" typically means limiting the audience to serious crypto
enthusiasts, which probably is an even smaller population than the
Matrix-curious. And even if users do put up with the blockchain baggage,
client software (especially on mobile!) would certainly not want to
synchronize the whole blockchain. They'll lookup names by...calling a
centralized RPC endpoint like Infura, who can arbitrarily censor or
mislead users. Oops.

Fixing this needs two things:

1.  **Trustless light clients**: A way to interact with blockchain logic
    that neither trusts centralized endpoints nor has users synchronize
    the whole blockchain.
2.  **Fully off-chain non-equivocation**: A robust *off-chain* protocol
    for non-equivocating name bindings that does not require users to
    spam expensive layer-1 transactions for all name operations, but
    still inherits full blockchain security

By most measures, we are *almost* there. Disregarding weak subjectivity
issues, how complex they are to set up, etc, Ethereum light clients like
[Helios](https://github.com/a16z/helios) get us most of the way towards
1 — sadly, most alt-L1s don't have something similar. Nobody has really
built the latter yet (I *tried* building one on Bitcoin [way
back](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8584991/)), but
given the advances in fraud proofs, ZK, data availability proofs, etc,
it's probably "just an engineering problem".

I think the biggest challenge left might just be a *blockchain ecosystem
architecture* issue. Software in the "web3/crypto" space almost form a
nice closed loop, where crypto tooling is "composable" iff it plugs into
existing crypto tooling. Vast smart contract ecosystems sit locked
behind L1s visible only through centralized RPC providers since don't
even have decent light client APIs. And this problem will probably stay
as long as "cryptobros" mostly build for other cryptobros rather than
for a better Internet.

As for myself, I started [Mel](https://melproject.org), a project to fix
exactly this architectural problem. Mel wants to build a protocol
ecosystem that can actually be used for something like Xirtam, starting
with an L1 entirely focused on [trustless light clients that compose
with off-chain decentralized protocols](https://docs.melproject.org/),
but ultimately basic off-chain protocols themselves.

Once we have these building pieces, Xirtam-like confederal networks will
hopefully be a clear [Schelling
point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_(game_theory)).
Combining federated infrastructure with user sovereignty will get us a
much better combination of security, usability, and ease of development
than either the federated or P2P alternative.
