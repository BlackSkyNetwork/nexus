###### 00000001 Foreword
Crypto is perhaps best thought of as a countercultural movement that functions similar to a vortex, absorbing the curious who happen to fall into its pull, typically individuals who have been yearning for legitimate alternatives to a society of control, where top-down coercion is reinforced through advanced digital surveillance and questionable data-hoarding. Ultimately, crypto draws people towards a current outside of, and away from, legacy institutions. Given the universality of desired alternatives by crypto users, whose ideologies and visions can differ along geographical, cultural, and political divides, this crowd ends up radically heterogenous, even inconsistent at times, desiring their own goals and objectives from multiple vantage points. Due to the fundamentally decentralized nature of crypto, this means its discourse, ideology, and praxis necessarily depend on the crowds who take part in the movement.

Cryptocurrency initially emerged from a group who came to be known as cypherpunks, the movement arising in the intellectually bustling scene of the early 90's Bay Area culture. The cypherpunks sought to liberate themselves from mechanisms of socioeconomic control, including the desire for wide scale use of digital cryptography, which was initially monopolized by US’s national defense, and by creating a fully encrypted banking system as an actionable framework for combating state surveillance.

A key opening line from *A Cypherpunk’s Manifesto* by Eric Hughes, a founding member of the cypherpunk movement, lays out the foundational notion: “Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world,” honing in on privacy as power, while selectivity is the means through which that power is put into action. Yet, since *A Cypherpunk’s Manifesto* was released in 1993, autonomy and anonymity on the internet has decreased exponentially in tandem with the growing complexity of the internet itself.

To this day, corporate surveillance follows in the footstep of the longest tradition of state surveillance and control, that of powerful covert programs like CIA’s COINTELPRO, which survey supposedly “protected” corners of the cyberspace like an open book, gaining unrestricted and non-consensual access to data which can be used as “intelligence.” The internet has a long history of persecution of piracy sites like Napster and Pirate Bay and agorist markets like Silk Road that threaten the open distribution of digital goods and free trade under the guise of intellectual property and anti-terrorist laws. In the current zeitgeist, statist and corporate interests have aligned in a convergent war against the digital commons and those seeking sovereignty.

Despite the general ethos of anarchic decentralization, and the immense innovation in decentralized finance and coordination tools, the territory of crypto has not been immune to the reach of the double-headed beast of state and surveillance. Critical vision and drive towards decentralization has been lost in the hazy noise of bull markets, scams, and scandals. Beyond the presiding “number-go-up” mentality, web3 ethos has also been dominated by a more naive form of optimism: the solarpunk vision which encompasses the naive assumption that every person has the privilege to feel safe in an online culture of full transparency. Even though this movement has powerful countercultural momentum in the space of Ethereum, and has an ability to steer innovation towards more ecologically respectful ways of thinking, solarpunk has been marching, however unwittingly, full speed towards deeply entangling cryptocurrency with the state apparatus.

Satoshi’s utopian dream of “a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash” has been shattered by the ever-evading forces of Moloch. Pervasive KYC programs, ICO bans, and lately, the sanctions against the privacy-enabling application Tornado Cash have posed an existential risk to the sovereignty and autonomy of blockchain communities: instead of progressing crypto to be a liberating technology, regulation is now more deeply embedded within code. The rules, structures, and control mechanisms of the fiat world are invading like a virus.

In this moment of historical self-reflection, a new faction has been born to combat and prevent cryptocurrency from being fully captured: the lunarpunks, who believe cryptocurrency communities need to reclaim anonymity, as this will be one of the major catalysts to enabling a more free society. Only by establishing a true separation between crypto and fiat will it be possible to imagine a new world more in tune with the autonomous spirit of humanity. The more esoteric qualities of lunarpunk: receptive, cold, dark, transformative, are the complementary opposites of the solarpunk’s privileged optimism.

Issue 0000001 of *Black Sky Nexus* brings into focus the larger theme of achieving autonomy through anonymity. The pre-release of the issue features privacy-centric research and reviews of current crypto projects and applications, as well as guides for developers and crypto users to steer their online activity towards enhanced anonymity. We are publishing articles iteratively with a digital publication date for the whole issue set for late November. In the meantime, we are [open for submissions](/zine/00000001/call-for-submissions) and are seeking additional material for this issue.
