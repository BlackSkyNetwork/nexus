###### Foreword
Crypto is perhaps best thought of as a counter cultural movement that functions similar to a vortex, absorbing the curious who happen to fall into its pull, typically individuals who have been yearning for legitimate alternatives to a society of control, where top-down coercion is reinforced through advanced digital surveillance and questionable data-hoarding. Ultimately, crypto draws people towards a current outside of, and away from, legacy institutions. Given the universality of desired alternatives by crypto users, whose ideologies and visions can differ along geographical, cultural, and political divides, this crowd ends up radically heterogenous, even inconsistent at times, desiring their own goals and objectives from multiple vantage points. Due to the fundamentally decentralized nature of crypto, this means its discourse, ideology, and praxis necessarily depend on the crowds who take part in the movement. 

Cryptocurrency initially emerged from a group who came to be known as cypherpunks, who sought to liberate themselves from mechanisms of socioeconomic control, the movement arising in the intellectually bustling scene of the early 90's Bay Area culture. The cypherpunks sought to liberate themselves from mechanisms of socioeconomic control, including the desire for wide scale use of digital cryptography, which was initially monopolized by USâ€™s national defense, and by creating a fully encrypted banking system as an actionable framework for combating state surveillance.
