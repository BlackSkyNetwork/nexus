###### 00000001 Foreword
Crypto can be thought of as a countercultural movement functioning similar to a vortex, absorbing the curious who happen to fall into its pull, typically individuals who have been yearning for legitimate alternatives to a society of subjection, where top-down coercion is reinforced through fiat currencies, impenetrable bureaucracy, and ubiquitous surveillance. Crypto draws people towards a current outside of, and away from, traditional institutions. Crypto adherents are a diverse group, whose ideologies and visions differ along geographical, cultural, and political divides. The movement is radically heterogenous, with different members having divergent, sometimes contradictory goals. Due to the fundamentally decentralized nature of crypto, this means its discourse, ideology, and praxis necessarily depend on the groups who take part in the movement.
 
Cryptocurrency initially emerged from a group who came to be known as cypherpunks, the movement arising in the intellectually bustling scene of the early 90's Bay Area culture. The cypherpunks sought to liberate themselves from mechanisms of socioeconomic control. They sought the wide scale use of digital cryptography, which was once monopolized by global militaries, to create a fully encrypted financial and communication ecosystem as a framework for combating state surveillance and control. It was the eponymous cypherpunk mailing list where Satoshi Nakamoto first introduced Bitcoin in 2008.
 
A key opening line from *A Cypherpunk’s Manifesto* by Eric Hughes, a founding member of the cypherpunk movement, lays out the foundational notion: “Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world,” honing in on privacy as power, while selectivity is the means through which that power is put into action. Yet, since Hughes wrote these words in 1993, autonomy and anonymity online has decreased exponentially in tandem with the growing complexity of the internet itself.
 
Twenty-nine years later, corporate surveillance follows in the footsteps of a long tradition of state surveillance and control, that of powerful covert programs like Echelon, COINTELPRO, and PRISM. Modern corporations survey supposedly “protected” corners of cyberspace like an open book, gaining unrestricted and non-consensual access to data which can be used as “intelligence.” The state has a long history of persecuting data-sharing sites like Napster and Pirate Bay and shutting down agorist markets like Silk Road, acting in the name of intellectual property and anti-terrorist laws to secure its powers of surveillance and taxation. In the current zeitgeist, statist and corporate interests have aligned in a convergent war against the digital commons, free trade, and those seeking sovereignty.
 
Despite the general ethos of anarchic decentralization, and the immense innovation in decentralized finance and coordination tools, crypto has not been immune to the reach of the double-headed beast of state surveillance nethand control. Cypherpunks’ original vision of a decentralized financial system has been lost in a haze of thieving hacks, scams, and self-promotion. In contrast to the “number-go-up” mentality of crypto greed, the web3 community saw the emergence of a new ethos: solarpunk. Solarpunks reject zero-sum individual wealth accumulation and focus instead on the creation of technological public goods, the synergy between crypto and regenerative agriculture, and positive-sum community building. While these are admirable goals, solarpunks maintain that every person has the privilege to feel safe in an online culture of full transparency. This strikes many as deeply naive. By partnering with mainstream venture capital, solarpunks’ countercultural momentum has been unwittingly co-opted into entanglement with corporate and state control and surveillance. 
 
Satoshi’s utopian dream of “a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash” has been shattered by the pervasive forces of Moloch. Invasive KYC programs, fumbling efforts by the SEC and CFTC to regulate crypto, and lately, state sanctions against Tornado Cash pose an existential risk to the sovereignty and anonymity of blockchain communities. Instead of solarpunks helping crypto to mature into liberating technology that cypherpunks envisioned, their funding and gloss have served as the camel’s nose in the tent, bringing government oversight and regulation directly into the source code. The rules, structures, and control mechanisms of the fiat world are invading like a virus.
 
In this historic moment, a new faction has emerged to save cryptocurrency from full state capture: the lunarpunks. They believe that cryptocurrency communities need to reclaim anonymity as a catalyst for a freer society. The lunarpunk philosophy holds that only by establishing a true separation between crypto and fiat will it be possible to create a new world in tune with the autonomous spirit of humanity. The esoteric qualities of lunarpunk: cold, dark, clear-eyed pragmatism, transformative, are the complementary opposites of solarpunk: warm, bright, rose-tinted optimism, incrementalist.
 
Issue 0000001 of *Black Sky Nexus* discusses the larger theme of achieving autonomy through anonymity. The pre-release of the issue features privacy-centric research and reviews of current crypto projects and applications, as well as guides for developers and crypto users to steer their online activity towards enhanced anonymity. We are publishing articles iteratively with a digital publication date for the entire issue set for late November. In the meantime, we are [open for submissions](/zine/00000001/call-for-submissions) and actively seek additional material for this issue.
