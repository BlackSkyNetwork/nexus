Black Sky Nexus is open for submissions related to the theme of Issue 00000001, *Autonomy through Anonymity*, which focuses on the roles of privacy and anonymity as essential elements of digital self-defense and self-organization, cypherpunk history, and lunarpunk potentialities. Submissions must be original and previously unpublished work and can include: art, articles, op-eds, comics, videos, animation, interviews, satire, or other informative media.


## SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

* In the body of the email, include one or two paragraphs (250  words max) summarizing your submission and why you feel it is a good fit for the theme of the issue. 
    * Example: “I’m including an art submission of original digital graphics depicting what I imagine the future will look like without the human race prioritizing encryption and freedom from surveillance.”
    * Make sure to also clarify the following:  a) what is your intended audience and b) what value does it provide for them (useful resources, novel conceptualizations, aesthetic enjoyment etc).

* Include the actual submission as an attachment. (For any written content, please use an easily readable font in your submission).
