*On January 27th, we received an anonymous submission in our Nexus email with the title "Balenciaga Revolution" and a seemingly void body.*

*We lately discovered that there was an invisible text with an encrypted cipher hidden in plain sight. After some months, we cracked it with the key "hyperstition". Below you will find its contents:*

:::

2023: It all started from a Balenciaga catwalk featuring light protective gear and tactical face coverings. The meme “Balenciaga will come for you” goes viral, generating a retail-side demand for the collection.

    [Add meme - Midjourney prompt: Slighly out of focus screengrab of a fashion model on a balenicaga catwalk wearing all-black light protective gear and a futuristic military-looking helmet with a balenicaga logo covering the whole face, the photo is only showing the part of the body above the waist and up front-facing and slightly rotated to the right by 30 degress --ar 3:2 --v5 ]

Balenciaga launches a campaign and invests in R&D for cost-efficient mass production. Resellers further drive down the cost of owning a piece.

2024: An insider leaks that Balenciaga is conducting a round of large-scale product research and that military-grade protective gear is included as part of the choices in the surveys. Quickly, a group of 4hanners organizes in order to troll the survey and bias it toward this option. The identities and intentions have never been made clear but some independent investigators conjecture that individuals have also been members of an anonymous DAO with guerilla political nudging activities. Balenciaga chooses to respond to popular demand.

2025: Balenciaga Labs is established in partnership with biomimetic materials science labs worldwide. They invest 5 million USD in researching adaptive, ultra-lightweight, bullet and shock-proof protective materials. The details of their materials have been kept private but many have conjectured that they used thin layers of D3O. Later in the year, they begin experimenting with full military-grade protective gear. Meanwhile, in December, DarkFi members launch “The Agora,” a dark market operating on Nym’s mixnet.

2026: Balenciaga hires a team of memetic engineers, to create a multimedia advertisement campaign promoting their mass-production initiative as a means for revolution against violence.

2027: A new type of material based on a synthetic mix of organic compounds is invented, passing stress tests with a 80x marginal improvement rate to basic kevlar and a 20x reduction in production costs. France, Japan, Nigeria and Brazil open up industrial cultivation centers reducing automation bottlenecks and labor through facilities for self-growing material. Balenciaga outsources production to these centers.

2028: Balenciaga launches the HaX0r outfit, a lightweight full-body kevlar gown that gain traction amongst the youth and puts a limited number on auction. Martian TAO, an Urbit-based organization, pools funds to buy them and resells them on The Agora where a channels of crypto-anarchist in Venezuela use them to put pressure on the Venezuelan government and install a parrallel anarcho-syndicalist confederation across municipal regions.

2029: Consumer demand prompts Balenciaga to mass-produce their designs. Local groups equipped with precision nano-array 3D printers find a low-cost way to reproduce the bulletproof outfits by using mycelium-based adaptive biomatter and share the blueprints on piracy channels in The Agora. Martian TAO acquires 29% of Kerings’s stock, Balenciagas parent company.

2030: Balenciaga tries to crack down on local piracy efforts, but US intelligence intercepts the privacy channels. Martian TAO sells all their shares, causing a massive downturn in the market and further panic selling.

2031: Lunarwear, a decentralized streetwear production company operating on The Agora, develops its own protective patents. SwerveSoc, an anonymous guild of technicians, raises a 6 million seed round to research cost-efficient 3D printing of 3D printing components.
