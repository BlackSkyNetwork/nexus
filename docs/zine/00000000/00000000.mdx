Black Sky is an emerging DAO on a mission to minimize dystopia and maximize harmony with the cosmos. Our aim is to organize a large-scale network of individuals who will utilize crypto technologies to mitigate the damage that nation states and corporations have imposed on the human experience. 

We are currently a small collective of writers, researchers, artists, and technologists who are launching Black Sky Nexus, a wiki and zine, for the purpose of developing relevant resources to promote greater engagement and community around the following topics: large-scale cooperative DAOs; open source resources for new crypto explorers; the role of technology and privacy in the evolution of human rights; how crypto can benefit the arts and vice versa; new modalities for healing the ecosphere; humanity’s relationship with the cosmos.

Black Sky Nexus includes educational guides, in-depth inquiries, informational articles, embedded NFTs, in addition to comedic or sci-fi extrapolations.

As we are beginning to pursue funding opportunities for this project, we have prepared a *preview* issue of Black Sky Zine: `Issue 00000000`. Enjoy.
