Black Sky Nexus includes educational guides, in-depth inquiries, informational articles, in addition to comedic or sci-fi extrapolations for the purpose of developing relevant resources to promote greater engagement and community around the following topics: large-scale networks of cooperation; open source resources for new crypto explorers; the role of technology and privacy in the evolution of human rights; how crypto can benefit the arts and vice versa; new modalities for healing the ecosphere; humanity’s relationship with the cosmos. ([Learn more about these topics here](https://www.blacksky.network/nexus).)

 In addition to being a digital resource, Black Sky Nexus has plans to materialize as a print publication in the future. As we are beginning to pursue funding opportunities for this project, we have prepared a *preview* of Black Sky Nexus: `Issue 00000000`. We also invite you to join the [Black Sky Discord](https://discord.gg/TrFzBxzCHH) to have discussions on our articles and initiatives. (Note: if you purchase one of the NFTs from the featured artists, 50% of the profits go toward Black Sky Nexus)
