A Transformative Autonomous Organization, or TAO, is a highly adaptive organization, composed of an autonomous membership class that are able to transform their organization's governance to become more centralized or more decentralized, easily flipping between modes if desired, with changes triggered by a vote. 

A TAO can be considered a type of Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), where:
* Hierarchies can more easily and acceptably be established and dismantled;
* Members welcome being part of an evolving governance experiment; and
* Voting models closer to *one person, one vote* that provide anonymity are favored over transparent models weighted based on capital contribution.

With TAOs, an organization’s power dynamics can better react to conflict, better adapt to changes in the world, and better adapt to large-scale organizational growth. TAOs aim to be antifragile. TAOs are [lunarpunk](https://www.egirlcapital.com/insights/107533289).

[AssangeDAO](https://assangedao.org) is a community that may be better off as a TAO. For example, it is a serious concern of the community that AssangeDAO can possibly become infiltrated with CIA operatives, and there are [multiple](https://www.dw.com/en/spanish-security-firm-spied-on-julian-assange-for-cia-report/a-50617356) [sources](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/sep/27/senior-cia-officials-trump-discussed-assassinating-julian-assange) of evidence that help prove this concern isn't mereley a conspiracy. 

But if a trusted community member does at some point uncover evidence of infiltration - that for example, DAO votes are being manipulated by the undercover operatives - then it will not be the most intelligent move to share that evidence on a public forum as just because there is evidence doesn't mean it's valid. Additionally, the operative's goal may also be to become discovered as an operative and to cause panic and disorder. 

Instead, it is important for such an organization to have a highly trusted group of people, such as the [Assange Family](https://forum.assangedao.org/t/3rd-snapshot-proposal-aip-assange-family-role-in-the-assangedao-assangedao/756), to share the evidence with, who can evaluate the evidence independently. If AssangeDAO was a TAO, then once the evidence is validated, the Assange Family can create a *Transformation Proposal* to temporarily modify the TAO's governance to a more centralized mode until a decentralized form of governance that better accounts for operatives is presented.

TAOs don't exist today though, but it is something I am interested in experimenting with in the world. Smart contracts to support a TAO would be much more complex than a DAO, since all of the potential governance modes would be required to be already coded and deployed. But TAOs would in fact be more secure than performing a traditional DAO upgrade, and hence antifragile. 

A rough outline of an opinionated TAO system is presented below. This is being shared to start a discussion around the idea. This is definitely not a comprehensive design as many of the areas still need to be thought through more. Comments and feedback are very appreciated.

## Governance Levels
One of the main differences between a TAO and a regular DAO is that a TAO will come pre-configured with multiple possible governance configurations, or *Governance Levels*.

Here is a potential set of Governance Levels:
- **Level 1 - Single TAO**: The TAO is a direct democracy, where all members can vote on all issues. There is only a single smart contract for the TAO. 
- **Level 2 - Sub-TAOs**: There are working groups / units, aka sub-TAOs, responsible for different focus areas. Whenever a TAO is a Level 2 organization, it's possible for the sub-TAOs to have autonomy over how it is governed. For example, the sub-TAO can transform to be a direct democracy or to be a VP-led organization, and these transformation votes will be controlled by sub-TAO members whenever the parent TAO is a Level 2 organization. There will be a smart contract per sub-TAO, enabling management of independent treasuries. 

The additional paremeter that needs to be set during a transformation is establishing the different stakeholder groups that should exist and hence be granted authority over different organizational functions or sub-TAOs. Some possibilities are a membership class, where membership is defined by holding an asset or NFT, other possibilities are an elected board or an elected president.

This may result in governance possibilities such as:
- **Member (A) Controlled**: Members have authority over creating new sub-TAOs or dismantling them and electing their leaders. Members have authority over firing and hiring.
- **Board (B) Controlled**: A board elected by members has control over creating new sub-TAOs or dismantling them and electing their leaders. The board has authority over firing and hiring.
- **President (C) Controlled**: There is one single person who has been voted to be the President / Executive Director of the TAO. The president has control over creating new sub-TAOs or dismantling them and electing their leaders. The president has authority over firing and hiring.

### Granular Governance
Whenever a TAO is a level 2 organization, the assumption is that the TAO transforms from having a single smart contract to manage it's funds, to having one smart contract per sub-TAO, as level 2 is when sub-TAOs become empowered to lead a particular focus area. This means that Sub-TAOs will be able to manage independent treasuries. 

Yet there are two major permissions that would need to be controlled / defined when enabling a sub-TAO or creating a new sub-TAO and those will be:
* Which stakeholder group is able to inactivate the sub-TAO, forcing the return of its assets to the main DAO?
* Which stakeholder group is able to distribute more funds to the sub-TAO from the main TAO?

It's possible to have more granular design over decision-making processes, such as increasing or decreasing token supply being in control by members, yet sub-TAO creation being controlled by a President.

Regardless of which governance level is enacted, TAO members will always be able to modify it in the future by creating a *Transformation Proposal* (e.g. it's not a dictatorship!), but the frequency at which transformations occur is a parameter that may impact the rate at which such transformations can occur.

### Sub-TAOs: Example Configurations
Whenever a TAO is a Level 2 organization, that favors member control (A), some potential governance levels for the sub-TAOs are:
- **Level 2A.3 - Direct & Distributed**: The sub-TAO is a direct democracy, where all of the sub-org's participants can vote on all issues regardless of expertise. Anybody in the TAO can join the sub-TAO on their own accord and participate in the focus area.
- **Level 2A.2 - Board-led**: The sub-TAO is led by a committee / board composed of at least three people, which are elected by members of the TAO.
- **Level 2A.1 - VP-led**: There sub-TAO is led by a Vice President (VP) that has been elected by members of the TAO. The TAO as a whole also has a "Board of Directors", which is composed of all of the VPs.

But if the TAO is a Level 2, that favors president/executive control (C), it's possible for sub-TAOs to still exist, yet it's possible that the TAO enables the President to have authority over how the sub-TAOs are led or who the members of the sub-TAO are. Some potential governance levels are:
- **Level 2C.3 - President controlled, Direct & Distributed**: The sub-TAO is a direct democracy, where all of the sub-org's participants can vote on all issues, but the President has authority over removing or adding members to the sub-TAO.
- **Level 2C.2 - President controlled, Board-led**: The sub-TAO is led by a committee / board composed of at least three people, which are appointed by the President of the TAO.
- **Level 2C.1 - President controlled, VP-led**: There sub-TAO is led by a Vice President (VP) that has been appointed by the president of the TAO. The TAO as a whole also has a "Board of Directors", which can different than the VPs of the sub-TAOs.

Some TAOs may be more static and will chose not to transform their Governance Level very often. For example, a TAO may decide to always operate with Level 2A governance yet allow Level 2C governance when the TAO is being litigated. The power of a TAO model is having the optionality to adapt to unpredictable conditions and also to embrace more scientific experimentation of organization design.

## Initialization Parameters
Whenever a new TAO is configured there will be important parameters that are initialized. One is the *Frequency of Transformation* which controls how often a TAO can become transformed. Another is the *Enabled Governance Levels* which controls the valid *Governance Levels* that the TAO can become transformed into. These parameters can be updated after the TAO is deployed. The other parameter is the *Initial Governance Level* which defines the TAO's initial governance model.

Of course there will have to be parameters that establish how proposals can be passed - such as the quorum and approval percentage required. The TAO can configure different thresholds for *Standard Proposals* vs. *Transformation Proposals* since transforming governance levels is a much more serious event than simply funding a project/idea.

With *Antifragile Mode* enabled, organizations can enact immediate, emergency transformations to Level 1 to 3 organizations. When this option is enabled, TAO members can always anonymously vote on who the de facto leaders would be should the organization need to immediately transform into a Level 1 to 3 organization.


Leaders will be elected via liquid democracy of TAO members. If *Antifragile Mode* is enabled, TAOs should have de facto leaders lined up even while the organization is still primarily a member-controlled organization. For such a use case, nobody in the TAO knows who the de facto leaders are until the leaders are empowered. De facto leaders will be in power for a limited amount of time, until official elections conclude.

## Transformation Proposal
TAO members can submit a transformation proposal whenever they feel it's important to transform their organization's governance. The proposal should include detailed *Justification* for transforming the organization. For example:

> We are currently configured as a Level 2A.3 organization, but our sub-TAO is exhibiting a tyranny of structurelessness. There are obvious people that are the main leaders of the sub-TAO but there is currently no good way for holding them accountable. Instead of pretending like we are running fully decentralized units in our operations, let's transform into a Level 2A.2 organization.

- Justification
- New Governance Level
- New Permission Set
- Transformation Duration
  - Indefinite
  - 6 months, 1 year, etc.
- Enactment Date
  - Immediate - after vote is resolved (only an option when Antifragile Mode enabled)
  - (x) days after vote concludes
- Official Election Date (If Level 1 to 3 transformation)
  - (x) days after vote concludes

## Voting Parameters
Voting models closer to *one person, one vote* that provide anonymity are favored over transparent models weighted based on capital contribution.
- Anonymous voting is enabled with zero-knowledge proofs
- One person, variable voting weight, based on contributor level
    - Sybil resistance is based on the limits of human contribution
    - Sample voting weights:
        - 1x - Contributing <5 hours a week
        - 3x - Contributing <10 hours a week
        - 5x - Contributing 20 hours a week
- New contributors start off with no voting powers, they are member-candidates
    - On a quarterly basis, members vote in new governing members and also decide upon each member’s voting weights

## Conclusion
These are just some initial thoughts on what a TAO system can look like. Thank you Peter Phillips for making critical contributions to the design of TAO governance levels. Defining how each Governance Level works will definitely require more thought and consideration - each will require a detailed specification. As TAOs evolve over time, it's possible the number of levels will grow and expand, but that would require a smart contract upgrade to support such expansion.
