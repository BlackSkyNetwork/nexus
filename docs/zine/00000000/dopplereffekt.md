On December 20, 2020, Dopplereffekt premiered their piece _Relativistic Singularity_ during the online event Azimuth, which was viewed live in the metaverse by an audience of avatars around the globe.

During this time, online streaming events were still in a relatively nascent stage amid the pandemic. This event took place on  the eve of the great conjunction and  was the culmination of a collective vision to make a gathering in which  people could be “together” in some realm despite COVID restrictions. The event itself  laid down the groundwork for what is now Black Sky. 

We were extremely honored to have Dopplereffekt take part in this virtual event,  as their work aligns deeply with our own cosmic curiosity and watching Dopplereffekt’s highly developed interaction of sounds and visuals can feel like receiving a transmission of knowledge from a distant future. 

Black Sky has minted _Relativistic Singularity_ as an NFT which can be [bid on here](https://zora.co/collections/zora/7799). We believe this may be the first ever performance NFT that has ties to the early Detroit techno underground: Dopplereffekt’s Heinrich Mueller is one half of the seminal nautical futurist duo [Drexciya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drexciya). Longform performance NFTs have not yet become widely adopted but we believe this format will soon gain traction as an avenue for fans to be able to own unique performances in an artist’s history.

Dopperleffekt always covers an array of intriguing scientific topics in their work, including their latest album _[Neurotelepathy](https://leisuresystem.bandcamp.com/album/neurotelepathy)_ which is about “considerations of the machine-human interface, neurological realities and physical probabilities.” _Neurotelepathy_ is on the label Leisure System and is Dopplereffekt’s first album in five years. The album was released digitally on April 14th via Bandcamp and the vinyl release is already sold out.

If you love all things Heinrich Mueller, we also recommend you check out his new project with Julia Pello, _[Mirovaya Liniya](https://mirovayaliniya.bandcamp.com/)_, which is Russian for “World Line”. Mirovaya Liniya takes you on a haunting poetic journey of spoken word woven into transcendent soundscapes. The coalescing of these energies incites emotions and visions from alternate realities. The music punctuates the reflections that are articulated, propelling questions deep into one’s subconsciousness to be answered later in a dream.
