:::note NOTE
The following is a sample of an in-depth article in progress outlining and proposing a model for a new type of crypto-funded organization. The final article in the zine will be a longer, polished, analytic version of this model.
:::

A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is a group organized around a common mission that coordinates through a shared set of rules enforced via blockchain technology and social consensus. Over 4,800 DAOs have been created to date, managing over $7B in assets (based on current market value) <sup>[1](#references)</sup>.

DAOs allow humans to experiment with organization design and economics with greater ease than traditional fiat-based organizations, since smart contracts and code are typically at the core of a DAO. They have the potential to scale organizations in a way that enables more worker-autonomy and squad wealth <sup>[2](#references)</sup>.

Nowadays, a DAO in most cases is an organization whose assets are managed by a smart contract. This can potentially mean a multisignature wallet with a handful of signers or even a token plutocracy with a CEO or Executive Director, which is not very inspiring for decentralization purists.

Gabriel Shapiro, DAO aficionado and legal hacker, recently published the article _[Defining Real and Fake DAOs](https://lexnode.substack.com/p/defining-real-and-fake-daos?s=r)_ where he states:

> ‚ÄúThe term ‚ÄòDAO‚Äô is applied to so many different organizations that it has become close to meaningless. I aim to correct this.‚Äù

Shapiro then goes on to emphasize why DAOs should be _decentralized_, _autonomous_, _organizations_ and defines the terms. I definitely appreciate his efforts of trying to nudge the crypto community towards a more ideological definition of what a real DAO is. However, I believe that this ship has unfortunately sailed, and since the term has been appropriated by varying organization forms, I‚Äôm comfortable with giving up implanting my vision of what the ideal DAO should look like. The term DAO can be sacrificed to the god of coordination failure: Moloch <sup>[3](#references)</sup>.

Instead of trying to redirect the DAO classification to be more meaningful, we should invent and propose alternative organizational systems with strong principles that are more specific, ideological, and challenge the status quo - to create schelling points around them. 

The [DisCO](https://disco.coop/) community has somewhat attempted this, but instead of calling a DisCO a *type* of DAO, they seem to be against the DAO community. I believe this anti-DAO narrative just adds a hurdle in adoption of the model, since by rejecting DAOs, they also reject the virality currently ascribed to DAOs. An alternative to this is to embrace the strong experimentation that exists within the DAO community and introduce DAO subtypes.

## Introducing TAOs

The Transformative Autonomous Organization, or TAO, can be considered a type of DAO. TAOs don't exist today in practice, but is a new model of crypto governance to nudge humanity closer to a world where we minimize dystopia and maximize harmony within the cosmos. They are smart contract based organizations that embrace software‚Äôs more nimble nature and reject the rigidity of corporate code, tradition, or efficiency.

TAOs are **transformative**. As software-based organizations, their governance is easily transformable and they intend to also transform organizations to become more collaborative as a whole.

TAOs are **autonomous**. Members of a TAO have the freedom to govern and control its affairs. TAOs intend to use artificial intelligence as a side kick, as opposed to an overlord, to reduce the work week and eventually, end labor.

TAOs are **organizations**. A TAO is an organized body with a _meaningful purpose_, especially a society, association, or coalition that intends to make the exploitive and restrictive aspects of business and professionalism obsolete.

They are inspired by cooperatives, Jo Freeman‚Äôs _The Tyranny of Structurelessness_, writings of Abdullah √ñcalan and Murray Bookchin, Rachel-Rose O‚ÄôLeary‚Äôs [Lunarpunk thesis](https://www.egirlcapital.com/writings/107533289), and Robert Anton Wilson‚Äôs [RICH Economy](https://web.archive.org/web/20100613011108/http://whywork.org/rethinking/whywork/rawilson.html).


## Six Pillars of TAO

TAOs will share a common set of pillars.

**Autonomously adaptive.** TAOs are highly adaptive organizations, composed of an autonomous membership class that are able to transform their organization's governance to become more hierarchical or more distributed as needed, easily flipping between modes. Establishing and dismantling hierarchies is easy and acceptable, yet always a member decision. TAOs favor democratic voting over plutocracies. Voting models that are closer to _one person, one vote_ that provide voter anonymity, are favored over transparent models weighted based on capital contribution.

**Optionally private.** TAOs do not need to be fully transparent or open organizations. Privacy, secrecy, and anonymity may be necessary for some type of TAOs, while others will benefit from having more open operations. TAOs are not maximilists in either direction, although within an organization, anonymous voting is the standard primitive.

**Motivated to end labor.** TAOs are interested in building towards a society where labor has ended. When productivity gains are enabled by advancements in technology, then ideally lives should improve, as opposed to the current dystopia where for example, wages for blue collar workers do not accelerate in the same way as the price of housing. This pillar aims to catalyze a culture where we continously imagine how a world without labor functions, and to attempt experiments that will propel society towards a direction where one's basic needs are met when born into the world.

**Concern for the cosmos.** TAOs are conscious of their relationship with the resources they extract from the cosmos and the labor conditions of their supply chain and they seek to ultimately maximize harmony over profits. In the beginning stages of TAO development (Years 1 - 5), it will be difficult for individual TAOs to do the best they can to maximize harmony, as the legacy systems are both pervasive and entrenched in pollution and slavery while harmonious models are more costly and potentially nonexistant. But the goal is that as more TAOs are created, that over time, maximizing harmony becomes easier and more affordable and legacy systems become obsolete. Nowadays, virtually all businesses and organizations are doing performative steps to signal "sustainability", "ecological awareness", etc. Guidelines to distinguish sincere methods from greenwashing will be important to uphold this pillar.

**Cooperation with other TAOs.** TAOs have mechanisms that encourage and facilitate cooperation by joining coalitions or proposing mergers with other TAOs. Members will consider merging or joining a coalition with another TAO with a similar mission before competing with them. Mergers are recommended for TAOs operating in similar regions whereas coalitions can be composed of TAOs that have the same mission yet operate in different regions. TAOs still encourage healthy competition among early stage TAOs, but mergers or coalitions should be proposed and facilitated, once the strengths of each TAO become obvious to properly distribute responsibilities in a multi-TAO model. The aim is that a cooperative mentality at the network level will enable TAOs to strengthen one another. 

**Embrace experimentation.** Members welcome being part of an evolving experiment in organization design and governance for the purpose of creating a more collaborative world where dystopia is minimized. Many of the pillars of a TAO include goals which are very difficult to achieve. Experimentation needs to also be a key pillar, since there are a lot of unknowns. TAOs will share the results of their experiments with the broader community to help evolve the TAO model.

Smart contracts to support a TAO would be much more complex than a DAO, since they take into account many more scenarios than existing governance frameworks by supporting mergers, coalitions, and de facto emergency stewards. With TAOs, an organization‚Äôs power dynamics can better adapt to conflict or adversarial scenarios, changes in the world, and large-scale organizational growth. TAOs aim to be antifragile and are [lunarpunk](https://www.egirlcapital.com/insights/107533289).

_The rest of this paper will focus the most on the **Highly adaptive** principle of TAOs. This is definitely not a comprehensive design, as many areas still need to be elaborated on and investigated in a theoretical model. Comments and feedback are very appreciated (share them in the [#üîÑ-taos](https://discord.gg/ZqYAbA6BVY) channel)._


## TAOs are Highly Adaptive

### Governance Levels

One of the main differences between a TAO and a regular DAO is that a TAO will come pre-configured with multiple possible governance structures, or _Governance Levels_.

There are two main parameters that are taken into account in determining the possible governance levels, and that's the _Enabled Organization Configurations_ and _Enabled Leadership Bodies_.

There are three possible _Organization Configurations_:

**Single TAO (1)**: The TAO has a singular organizational body, with only a single smart contract for the TAO (e.g. funds are held in a singular treasury). 

**Sub-TAOs (2)**: There are different guilds, aka sub-TAOs, responsible for different focus areas. An individual sub-TAO has autonomy over how it is governed. For example, the sub-TAO can transform from a member-led direct democracy to an organization where leadership functions are granted to a steward or set of stewards. Transformation votes will be controlled by sub-TAO members. There will be a smart contract per sub-TAO, enabling management of independent treasuries, yet the parent TAO has control over revoking funding from a sub-TAO.

**TAO of TAOs (3)**: The TAO includes a distinct membership base that distributes funding to a coalition of multiple independent TAOs. The primary governance activities of the TAO are to 1) allocate funding to each member entity and 2) manage coalition membership. When the TAO awards funding to coalition members, it cannot be revoked. TAO of TAOs organizations can also include sub-TAOs with revocable treasuries that have responsibility over specific higher level functions of the coalition.

The _Enabled Leadership Bodies_ are different stakeholder groups which can have potential control over the TAO‚Äôs primary functions. At the most basic level, this will include: **the membership class (A)**, an electable set of **multiple stewards (B)**, or an electable **singular steward (C)**. 

Assuming all _Organization Configurations_ and all default _Leadership Bodies_ are enabled in the TAO, there would be 9 potential Governance Levels that the parent TAO can transform into:

* Level 1A, Level 1B, Level 1C
* Level 2A, Level 2B, Level 2C
* Level 3A, Level 3B, Level 3C

Whenever a TAO transforms from a Level 1x to a Level 2x or 3x organization, the assumption is that the TAO transforms from having a single smart contract to manage its funds to having one smart contract per activated sub-TAO, as Level 2 is when sub-TAOs become empowered to lead a particular focus area. This means that sub-TAOs will be able to manage independent treasuries and may eventually even grow big enough to warrant further fractalization for the sub-TAO to break up into more sub-TAOs within itself.

Each governance level will come with preconfigured decision-making templates, but it's possible to modify the standard. For example, if an organization chooses to be a Level 2B organization yet deviates from the recommended permissions, they would be considered a Level 2B* organization or a _modified Level2B_ organization.

_Sample Template: Level 2B Organization (Sub-TAOs, Steward-led)_

A set of stewards elected by members has control over creating new sub-TAOs or inactivating them. The stewards also have authority over managing the TAO‚Äôs assets.

</table>


It's possible to have more granular design over decision-making processes, such as managing the token supply being in control by members, yet restricting the activation and deactivation of sub-TAOs to be controlled by a singular steward, and another permission being the responsibility of multiple stewards.

Regardless of which Governance Level is enacted, TAO members will always be able to modify it in the future by creating a _Transformation Proposal_ (i.e. it's not a dictatorship), but the frequency at which transformations occur is a parameter that may impact the rate at which such transformations can occur.

Some TAOs may be more static and will choose not to transform their Governance Level very often. For example, a TAO may decide to always operate with Level 2A governance yet allow Level 2C governance when the TAO is being litigated. The power of a TAO model is having the optionality to adapt to unpredictable conditions and also to embrace more scientific experimentation of organization design.


### Initialization Parameters

Whenever a new TAO is configured there will be important parameters that are initialized. One is the _Frequency of Transformation_ which controls how often a TAO can become transformed. This is a very important parameter, as allowing too frequent transformations can lead towards destabilization.

Another is the _Enabled Governance Levels_ which controls the valid _Governance Levels_ that the TAO can become transformed into. The _Governance Levels_ that can be enabled will be based on the _Enabled Organization Configurations_ and _Enabled Leadership Bodies_. Another related parameter is the _Initial Governance Level_ which defines the TAO's initial governance model.

Of course, there will have to be parameters that establish how proposals can be passed, such as the quorum, approval percentage, and proposal duration. The TAO can configure different thresholds for _Standard Proposals_ vs. _Transformation Proposals_ since transforming governance levels is a much more serious event than simply funding a project or idea.

Lastly, there is the _Antifragile Mode_ parameter. With _Antifragile Mode_ enabled, organizations can enact immediate, emergency transformations to steward-led governance. When this option is enabled, there be a continuous election proposal that is perpetually open.  TAO members can always anonymously vote on who the de facto stewards would be should the organization need to immediately transform. Nobody in the TAO knows who the de facto steward(s) are until the transformation is finalized. 

De facto steward(s) will be in power for a limited amount of time, until official elections conclude. Stewards can be elected either based on a liquid democracy or a standard election schedule.

TAO parameters can be updated after the TAO is deployed.

### Transformation Proposal

TAO or sub-TAO members can submit a transformation proposal whenever they feel it's important to transform their organization's governance. The proposal should include detailed _Justification, New Governance Level, Permission Modifications, Transformation Duration, Enactment Date, and Election Date _(if the transformation involves enacting Steward-led governance).  

A sample _Justification_ would be something like: 

> We are currently configured as a Level 2A organization, but our sub-TAO is exhibiting a tyranny of structurelessness. There are obvious people that are the main stewards of the sub-TAO but there is currently no good way for holding them accountable. Instead of pretending like we are running as a fully decentralized unit, let's transform into a Level 2B organization.

The _Transformation Duration_ can be indefinite, or can be something shorter term such as 6 months, 1 year, etc. _Permission Modifications_ allows customizations to the default permission set that accompanies the selected _New Governance Level_. The _Enactment Date_ can be _Immediate_, after the vote is resolved or it can be a number of days after the vote is resolved.

Note: If a TAO did not previously have a leadership body enabled, such as a **Singular Steward**, yet members would like to transform to empower a **Singular Steward** control over functions, then a proposal must be made first to modify the TAO's parameters before the _Transformation Proposal_ can be submitted.


### Governance Rights

Voting models closer to _one person, one vote_ that provide anonymity are favored over transparent models weighted based on capital contribution. Anonymous voting is enabled with zero-knowledge proofs.

TAOs are _permissioned_ organizations. Similar to the governance of cooperatives, new contributors start off with no voting powers, they are member-candidates. The _Membership Review Period_ defines the periodic basis where existing members vote in new governing members and also decide upon each member‚Äôs voting weights.

One idea is that TAOs will have _one person, variable weight_ voting based on contributor level. In this use case, sybil resistance is based on the limits of human contribution. Some sample voting weights can be:

* 1x - Contributing &lt;5 hours a week
* 3x - Contributing &lt;10 hours a week
* 5x - Contributing 20 hours a week

Note: it‚Äôs possible for TAO membership to be automated based on a member-candidate earning reputation, instead of tying the process to a member vote, but it‚Äôs important to be able to disable the algorithm and use human judgment when it seems as if: 1) the algorithm is being gamed or 2) the algorithm has created a dystopian environment in some other way. (Will elaborate on this more in the future).

## Next steps

These are just some initial thoughts on what a TAO ecosystem can look like.  It will be important moving forward to go a bit deeper on all of the principles. Additionally, defining the standards for each _Governance Level_ will definitely require more thought and consideration - each will require a detailed specification. As TAOs evolve over time, it's also possible the number of levels will grow and expand.

Thank you Peter Phillips for making critical contributions to the design of TAO _Governance Levels_.
