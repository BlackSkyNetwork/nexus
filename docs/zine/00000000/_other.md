## A Dynamic DAO Governance Model

 – when certain conditions occur in the community, power dynamics can change to resolve situations in the best possible way. E.g. Peacetime vs. Wartime governance.

Say for example, an adversarial party is trying to litigate a DAO - this is a Wartime scenario that may be best managed with electing one leader that will be the main point of contact in talking with lawyers, etc.


Inspired by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFCON - communities can either have an elected council that manages assessing the community’s DEFCON level or it can be assessed with the entire community’s vote. (Note: It won’t be called DEFCON - there will be a different name/acronym.)
When at 5, the community will have more decentralized governance, when at 1 the community will have more centralized governance.

The Dynamic DAO Governance Model will be governed most similarly to a worker-owned cooperative, although there are a few modifications:
- Instead of 1 person, 1 vote, voting weight is based on average contributions (e.g. if someone works an average of 10 hours a week they will have half the vote of someone who works 20 hours a week).
- Worker-owners of the DAO can elect a Board of Dynamic Directors, whose more centralized authority can be used in emergency or community grid-lock scenarios. This is managed with the DEFCON feature.
- The DAO will have working groups who have power/authority over different subjects.
- Within the working groups (WG), the there will be a set of Dynamic Directors of the WG similar to the network itself. They will be in power when the DEFCON level reaches that stage where it’s needed.

Dynamic DAO Governance Levels
Level 5 - Decentralized & Direct - Very flat / direct democracy - all participants can vote on all issues regardless of expertise.
Level 4 - Decentralized & Distributed - There are working groups that are responsible for different subject matters, but those working groups operate like direct democracies w/o any elected leaders
Level 3 - State Transition to Centralization - This is a level when you start preparing and transitioning to having delegates. Still operating like governance of Level 2 although elections are being prepared
Level 2 - Representative Democracy - Enacts once elections are over - there are WGs with dynamic directors in power
Level 1 - Benevolent Dictator Mode - 1 single person in power of entire community, and one VP per working group calling shots

There will be a de facto set of leaders that can be in power on a whim, without elections but there will always be an election to replace to de facto leaders.

Some communities may just want to be static, and always be Level 1 or always be Level 5, but ideally the system should support these 5 governance modes and allow communities to have dynamic governance based on DEFCON level.
