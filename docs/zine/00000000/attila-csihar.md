Void ov Voices is a project by Attila Csihar, best known as the singer of seminal black metal band Mayhem, as well as his numerous contributions to other bands notably Sunn O))) and Tormentor. 

An avid believer in extraterrestrial life and a bold explorer of the fringes of knowledge and creativity, Attila’s _Saturnalian_ performance is imbued with the energy of someone unafraid to go to the places others may fear to tread. He channels dark _Saturnalian_ energy while hypnotic layered visuals synchronize with his otherworldly guttural emoting and movements. 

This performance was initially aired during the online event Azimuth on December 20, 2020 on the eve of the great conjunction, an astrological occurrence forecasted by some to herald unforeseen darkness, but at the very least trigger some great upheaval.

It is a truly avant-garde performance exploring cosmic radiation and darkness. Upon assessing the reverberations of the great conjunction, it does seem like some strange changes have occurred in the world since then, and we are summoning the forces to continue working toward minimizing dystopia.

_Below is a transcript of two interviews with Attila: one that took place on December 10, 2020 and another on January 21, 2022._

###### 2020

##### Hi, Attila, can you please tell me more about you?

My name is Attila Csihar and I'm the vocalist of the band Mayhem from Norway and a bunch of other projects like Tormentor, Plasma Pool - my electro band, and Void ov Voices, my solo act.  I've been an experimental and metal musician since '85 and I had a lot of projects and bands. So I just named a few of the most important ones. I also played with a band called Sunn O))) from the US where I am the vocalist -- as of course, I'm a vocalist.

##### Do you believe in aliens?

That's a great question. I think I do. But I never had direct contact with them. Actually, my ex was abducted. She was strongly believing in them and I think what we perceive from this cosmos and from reality is a really, really tiny fraction of what is out there actually. Like, we can see this very tiny spectrum, part of the spectrum from the electromagnetic waveforms, which is like everything, basically. So I think it could be anything, anywhere.
‍
So for me, aliens are not just out in space, but they could be around us too - in other dimensions. Like in the middle ages how people talked about seeing demons and angels - I think they were aliens, too, in a way.

I have contacts with death, those kind of beings but more mentally and psychically but I have never seen a typical alien spaceship going around in the sky.

However, I saw some very strange sights here or there in my life, which I couldn't explain what they were. Once I saw this big orb in front of me, which was really there and I still have no explanation what it could be.

I also believe the planets have a spiritual energy. So I'm kind of spaced out, so to say.

##### What do you think about the Galactic Federation?

I could imagine they exist. I don't know much about them. I read about it. Of course, if the cosmos exists, like they describe, and I say "if" because I don't know if it's true that there are these billions of light years, you know, but for sure in the sky you can see billions of stars. They said that billions of galaxies which also contain billions of stars. So if we believe in that science, which is of course theoretical physics still, then I can imagine that there are so many alien worlds and maybe there is a Galactic Federation, which feels a bit like a Star Wars fantasy, but I can imagine it.

In a way, I believe, I know that there are other planets and there are other beings there. And in other dimensions too, that I know for sure. But I don't know about the Galactic Federation... exactly, like that, you know. It’s hard to answer. I can imagine. I believe in them one way, but I never had any contact with them. So far. You know what I mean?

##### Do you think we should expand into space or explore it?

Definitely. I think we should. Definitely. And I think we should open our minds. That I think it's also a key to space -- because I think it's not just physical, but it's psychic traveling. I think we should definitely experiment and explore more. Those dimensions and space itself.

##### AI: utopia or dystopia?

AI is reality  I think, as of now, it's not utopia at all. I mean, even this phone has AI, which I'm using now. I think it's a very interesting and very great thing, and very advanced. It can be used, like everything else, both ways. You know, you can use it for good or bad, bad purposes and reasons.

But the AI is definitely a new thing which exists, and it's already around us. I think it could be great. Like, an artificial intelligence could help us and mankind in so many ways, but it can be also dangerous. So, we really have to know the way we use it, and if we use it the right way, it's a great thing.

###### 2022

##### Can you tell us what sort of feelings or entities you were channeling during the _Saturnalian_ performance NFT?

The performance was about extraterrestrial or other dimensional intelligence and also channeling a transformation between human and android. More profoundly, it was about channeling the energy from the storm of the south pole of Saturn.

##### Do you think that NFTs will transform the music industry in any kind of way?

I think so. It will open new inspiration and opportunities for artists. Being an independent artist - we need that especially in this new age where possibilities for live performances are really limited. NFTs might give us an opportunity to create art for eternity in a different way... going into digital eternity. It's pretty interesting. The NFT art pieces can never decay. They will exist as long as blockchain technology does. So make a digital art-piece and give it life in the digital dimension... it's pretty exciting.

##### How else are you involved in cryptocurrency right now?

I have been mining Ethereum since 2016. I added Raven and Monero recently. I am also into some DeFi projects. Now NFT technology is really triggering since it is about art on the blockchain. I strongly believe in blockchain technology as the only possible future for the internet in the long term.

##### Do you have any thoughts on what you will be mining after Ethereum transitions fully to proof of stake (PoS)?

Good question. Well I am already mining Raven and Monero. However Monero is another genius which is CPU mining. Most of my hardware are GPUs. PoW (proof of work) was the original and real idea of blockchain transactions. PoS is great too and I am happy if it works, but then as some critics say we are back to people who have control depending on the amount of their assets in the PoS system. I am not an expert though and I know that PoS is about much more than that, but I think PoW should remain. It's still cutting edge technology and without so much human intervention involved. The more people and nodes involved in the mining, the less likely it's fragile.

##### What do you think about the environmental criticism when it comes to proof of work mining?

Well proof of work takes electricity no question. But the whole topic is kind of confusing still what's going on. It's a created energy crisis and one should not forget that more that 60% of electricity comes from fossils. When I entered into crypto in 2016 it was still considered drug and terrorist money in the mainstream media. We all know how many times Bitcoin has been slaughtered in the headline news. Now Elon Musk and other multis are involved... shows what we already knew that it's the future. So here is Elon Musk as one of the smartest and most successful scientists on the planet. He manufactures cars with Tesla which are actually using what? Electricity. So he should know what it costs.

Now he enters into crypto, making hype for BTC and Doge. Doge which was a joke in 2017. Nevertheless, this smart guy hypes up those coins and the markets. You know crypto is freedom so the only way to manipulate the market is fake news. So he did. Then he comes back that suddenly he "realized" that Bitcoin mining is not good for the environment? This guy says that, as if 6 months prior, he didn't understand? Come on hahaha...! Then coins drops and all his blinded followers are losing their money... More precisely sending it to Musk. It's just manipulation.

Both PoW and PoS are cutting edge technologies... we will see if there is one method that wins. I will keep going on with mining anyway. By the way - in the winter my machines provides my heating at home, so no heat bills and extra pollution.

##### And the closing question: what is an idea you have for minimizing dystopia?

Decentralized internet and digital freedom is certainly one of our last hopes. Mankind really needs a decentralized internet on top of what we already have. We actually should evolve centralized internet controlled by a handful of multis, back to the original idea of the internet, which was freedom of information instead of control and power.
