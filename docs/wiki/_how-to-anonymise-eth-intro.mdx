Ethereum, the most popular blockchain with smart contract functionality, is attracting a lot of users who are new to cryptocurrency with the explosion in adoption of NFTs. But it's important for new users to understand that Ethereum doesn't provide privacy features natively and that transacting on Web3 is actually much more *naked* than one is accustomed to when transacting on Web2.

In Web2, only your bank and service providers know the details of your financial transactions (unless you're using Venmo). In Web3,  if you aren't using privacy add-ons or specialized blockchains, then the entire world will know your transaction history.

This guide exists to educate people on the transparency of Ethereum and provide instructions on tools that can be used to achieve better anonymity on Ethereum.

## Primer on Ethereum's Transparency
If you decide to mint an NFT and someone subsequently puchases the NFT from you, it's possible for anyone to now observe what you do with the ETH (or ERC-20 token) that you receive. For example, if you navigate to a profile on Foundation such as:

https://foundation.app/@gaelcorboz

You can copy the Ethereum address, `0x0E5E9eC9DeDfbbD1cf97318a30831b008bd295C1` and then navigate to Ethereum's most popular block explorer, [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io), and paste in the address in the search bar. This will return this URL:

https://etherscan.io/address/0x0E5E9eC9DeDfbbD1cf97318a30831b008bd295C1

Now we are able to see how Gael Corboz has been spending cryptocurrency associated with their Foundation address. This behavior isn't limited to only Foundation, it's possible to determine the Ethereum address of anyone selling NFTs on OpenSea, Zora, Rarible, etc.

## Being anonymous on Ethereum
In this guide, you can learn how to anonymise Ethereum using two different possible apps: [zk.money](https://zk.money) and [Tornado Cash](https://tornado.cash). Both of these apps use [zero-knowledge proof cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof) to anonymise your Ethereum. These type of apps are called *mixers* because they achieve privacy by pooling money in a common smart contract. Whenever you use one of these protocols to transfer ETH, the address that will show up in the block explorer that is sending the ETH will be the zk.money or Tornado Cash smart contract, as opposed to your personal Ethereum address. 

For the case of zk.money, where it allows you to transact in variable amounts of ETH, it's important to think through how much money you are depositing into the pool, and how much you then withdraw from it as you can potentially de-anonymise yourself.

For example, if you decide to deposit 12.454 ETH into zk.money and then you withdraw exactly that same amount of *shielded ETH* to another address, then it is easy to de-anonymize yourself and have the transactions linked (if someone is looking closely at the smart contract, they can link the addresses together by matching the ETH deposit and withdrawl amounts as it may be very unlikely that another person besides you has transacted in that same amount of ETH).

Whenever you are sending ETH on zk.money it will provide an estimated size of the anonymity set for the transaction amount you'd like to send. Play around with the number until you see something you're comfortable with.

Tornado Cash controls this more at the app level, only allowing specific denominations of ETH to be sent (0.1 ETH, 1 ETH, 10 ETH).

Whether you decide to use zk.money or Tornado Cash, you will need to start off by creating a fresh Ethereum address.
