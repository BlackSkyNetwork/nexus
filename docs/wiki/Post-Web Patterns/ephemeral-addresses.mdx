# Ephemeral Addresses for Public Interactions
<span class="doc-subtitle">Post-Web Pattern</span>
<br/>

*NOTE: This pattern is a work in progress and needs to be further clarified and enhanced.*

**Overview**: In a wallet interface designed for privacy, use a default address as the primary "indexed address" and reserve ephemeral addresses for single-use scenarios, especially when engaging in public interactions, such as incoming cross-chain transfers.

**Details**: The wallet interface should display the default address for general use while keeping ephemeral addresses hidden or less accessible. These ephemeral addresses are intended for one-time use in more publicly visible transactions, such as incoming cross-chain transfers. The wallet interface should be designed to abstract ephemeral address usage from the user and avoid using the default address in public interactions.

**Benefits**: By associating public transactions with ephemeral addresses, any future actions using those funds within the system remain completely shielded, enhancing privacy.

**Technical Dependency**: The address key structure must be similar to the Zcash Sapling design to implement this pattern effectively.

**Example**: This pattern is inspired by [Penumbra's design](../../zine/00000001/penumbra-protocol), which employs ephemeral addresses for specific public interactions.
