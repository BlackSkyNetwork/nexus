# Wiki Introduction
Newcomers to cryptocurrency often have difficulty finding comprehensive resources pertinent to their specific areas of interest. Additionally, the crypto community has created many resource guides in the form of blog posts or Notion spaces, but these resources cannot be easily edited, enhanced, or expanded upon by others beyond the original authors.

Black Sky Wiki is an open source project licensed [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) that will include an evolving knowledge base that will initially focus on resources for those interested in learning about cryptocurrency, contributing to or founding DAOs, creating NFTs, and having more privacy or anonymity.
